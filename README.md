# Overview

This repo containerizes a Flask application using Docker, PostgreSQL, Gunicorn, and Nginx. PostgreSQL is used as the database to store structured data. Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP server to manage Flask in a production environment. Nginx is used as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests and improve performance. Docker is used to containerize all components, ensuring portability and easy deployment. Included is a production-ready Docker Compose file that adds Gunicorn and Nginx to handle static and media files.
